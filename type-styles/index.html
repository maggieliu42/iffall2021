    <!-- Create an html page demonstrating basic type styling using one of the font faces referenced below. Clearly indicate the typeface name and size in a summary at the top of the page, then demonstrate possible values for each of the following five CSS properties with a sample sentence: font-weight, font-style, letter-spacing, text-transform, text-decoration. Place each sample on its own line. Include a label for the group that shows which css property the group demonstrates. Include a label for each line that shows which value is used. Style the whole page to present your samples cleanly and clearly. -->
