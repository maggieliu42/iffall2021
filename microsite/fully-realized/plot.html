            <p>Breath of the Wild takes place at the end of the Zelda timeline in the kingdom of Hyrule. Protected by four enormous animalistic machines called the Divine Beasts and an army of autonomous weapons called Guardians.</p>

            <p>The kingdom of Hyrule had since regressed to a medieval state. Reading their ancestors' prophecies, the Hylians recognized the signs of Ganon's return and excavated surrounding areas to uncover the Divine Beasts and Guardians.</p>

            <p>However, Ganon possessed the Guardians and Divine Beasts, turning them against Hyrule. King Rhoam and the Champions were killed, the castle town was destroyed, and Link was gravely wounded while defending the Hyrulean Army's only remaining base, Fort Hateno.</p>
