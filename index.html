        <p>1. My name is Maggie Liu, I'm a Junior majoring in Communication Design</p>
        <p>2. I love illustration and I took this class not only becuse it is required but because I would like to learn how to make fun and engaging websites and portfolios this semester.</p>
        <p>3. I took Intro to CS my freshman year so I'm a bit familiar with coding, although I had no idea what I was doing back then because the class was so fast paced.<p>
        <p>4. One thing I hope to learn in this class is a better understanding of how CS or HTML works.</p>
        <p>5. I expect designing for a screen would be different from paper because of the consideration of user interaction, navigation for information, and overall engagement. There is also the consideration of different formats such as pc and mobile devices.</p>
        <p>6. A website I think exemplifies effective design is https://www.healthline.com/ because the home page has great visuals, interesting article headlines, and various other useful resources on the top tab. The contents on the page are organized clearly and effectively, and looks very proffesional and relaxing.  
        <p>7. A website I think exemplifies effective communication is https://www.sanrio.com/ because navigating the website is easy and simply hovering over the top tabs gives us many options and allows us to find specific things we are looking for. 
        <p>8. A website I think works well is https://www.jenniferxiao.com/. Her portfolio is set up with a fun and engaging welcome page that is interesting and easy to use. It shows off her personality, artstyle, and aesthetic from its simple icons and overall strucutre. </p>
